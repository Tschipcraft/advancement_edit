> A data pack for 1.13x-1.19x

## Features

A old data pack I decided to upload which replaces the title of the advancement "We Need to Go Deeper" with "Welcome to Hell (:".
This was originally a community request by @kestrel1110


## Installation

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/advancement_edit/releases/latest) and put the data pack .zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world.
